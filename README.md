# Bounce-MyFirstGame

##Description

This is the first game I've made in Java! It's a game where you dodge enemies blocks. 
I implemented a point system to calculate your high score and a shop system to buy
things like health and upgrades.

##Lessons from project

-I learned about making a game engine 
-It strengthened my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming
