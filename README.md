## Description

This is the first game I've made in Java! It's a game where you dodge enemies blocks. 
I implemented a point system to calculate your high score and a shop system to buy
things like health and upgrades. I also used a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) called 
Reaper to create the music.


## Installing

You will have to have java installed on your machine to run this application. You can
use eclipse or netbeans to run "Main.java".

## How to Play
- Use arrow keys to move player and dodge enemies
- Face different and unique enemies in higher levels
- Reach different levels and get the highest score!

## Known Bugs
- sometimes when playing the "normal mode", game crashes. Still figuring out why

## Build With
Eclipse - a java ide

## Lessons from project

- I learned about making a game engine 

- It strengthened my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming
